Hospital system
There is only backend of the Project Milestone 3 (Unfortunately) <br>
The backend part of the web-site was written in Django Framework (Python). Frontend will be written in ReactJS (but is not ready, unfortunately) <br>
---
In order to run the web-site locally in your computer you have to: <br>
  -Install python (python3.10 preferred) <br>
  -Install Django (last version of Django preferred) <br>
  -Create your virtual environment (just google "Python venv") <br>
  -Install following libraries in your virtual environment: django, pillow (any version will do, i believe) <br>
  -Make migrations if needed (google migrations in Django) <br>
  -Run your server: ```python manage.py runserver``` (!Keep in mind that you have to be in the same folder where your ```manage.py``` file is located) <br>
  *There is 1 predefined admin account: <br> -username: admin <br>
                                        -password: admin
